def main():
    #This is a variable storing a single string
    fun = "I Love Python"

    #This is a list containing 3 items, all strings
    animals = ["dog", "cat", "bird"]

    #This is a list containg 3 items, all integers
    nums = [7,2,99]

    #Let's see how each displays
    print(fun)
    print(animals)
    print(nums)
    print("\n")


    #indexed positions
    #To be able to use data from a list we have to be able to access it and pull it out or put it in
    #Every item in a list has a numbered (indexed) positions, items are separated by commas
    #indexed positions start count at 0 from the left
    #So dog in the list of animals is in indexed position 0
    print(animals[0])
    print(animals[1])   #is cat
    print(animals[2])   #is bird

    #We can also access it from the right side or the end of the list using negative indices
    print(animals[-1])    #will display bird - the last item in the list (or first from the right)
    print(animals[-2])    #will display bird - the 2nd item in the list (or second from the right)



    #Now we will practice using various methods on our lists
    #A method changes a list instantly and permanently since lists are mutable
    #This is not the same on a variable storing a single value

    #Some methods cannot be passed any arguments, some must be passed arguments
    #And some can be passed arguments, but do not have to be
    #append adds to the end of a list - takes 1 argument
    animals.append("fish")
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #insert adds to a position in a list - must pass 2 arguments
    animals.insert(0,"lizard")
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #pop removes from the list - by default the last item if no arguments
    print(animals.pop())
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #pop can also remove a location if you pass it 1 argument
    print(animals.pop(0))
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #remove will also remove from a list - but a specific item passed to it
    animals.remove("cat")
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #del in an instruction not a method - can be used in a list or on a whole list
    del animals[1]
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #Let's put 2 things back in our list for the next part
    animals.append("bird")
    animals.append("cat")
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #The sort method will make it ascending (a-z) and store it that way
    animals.sort()
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    # reverse reverses the list so
    # if you want z-a you must first sort it a-z
    animals.reverse()
    print(animals)
    print("\n")

    #We've only been using the list of strings, but it does the same thing with nums
    print(nums)
    nums.sort()  
    print(nums)
    print("\n")

    nums.reverse()
    print(nums)
    print("\n")

    #The sorted function will display A-Z but not store it that way
    print(sorted(animals))
    print(animals)

    print("\n")
    
    #The len function will count items in a list
    print(len(animals))
    print(len(nums))
    print("\n")

    #When you pass len a string - it counts number of characters in a string
    print(len(fun))
    print("\n")

    #The sum function is a fast way to add up a bunch of numbers stored in a list
    print(sum(nums))
    print("\n")

    #We can easily find an average of any amount of numbers stored in a list
    #by combining the sum and len functions
    print(sum(nums)/len(nums))

    print("\n")

    #We often loop through lists to make more effiecient code
    for animal in animals:
        print(f"I love {animal}")

    print("\n")


    for number in nums:
        print(number ** 3)

    print("\n")

    # Here's and example checking items in a list
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            print("Even")
        else:
            print("Odd")
